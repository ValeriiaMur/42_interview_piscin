A queue is a collection in which the entities in the collection are kept in order.
All operations are in O(1) space and time.
This is First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.

The difference between stacks and queues is in removing: 
-In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; 
-In a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
