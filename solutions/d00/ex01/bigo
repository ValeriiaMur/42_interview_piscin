With both sub-sorts performed recursively, quick sort requires O(n)
extra space for the recursion stack in the worst case when recursion 
is not balanced.

Time complexity:  O(n2) in the worst case. On Average, O(n log (n))
Space cimplexity: O(log (n)) where n is the number os items that should
be sorted
