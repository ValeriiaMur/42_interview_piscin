For text of length n and p patterns of combined length m, 
its average and best case running time is O(n+m) in space O(p), 
but its worst-case time is O(nm). 

N is thre length of test.
P stands for patterns 
M is their combined lenght

The effectiveness of the hash computation function
is a deciding factor during the calculation of time complexity of this
algorithm.
