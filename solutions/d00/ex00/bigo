This search is known as a simple search. Even though binary search works faster, we can't apply it here
because we are working with an unsorted list. The time it took to execute this algorithm called linear time 
or O(n).N stands for a number of operations.
The longer out list, the longer it will take to find the needed entry. Since big O notation establishes 
a worst-case run time, it means we'll have to check all of the nearly 100.000 artworks to find the right one
(in the worst case when it's the last one in the list).
