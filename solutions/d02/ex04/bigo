Counting sort is a sorting technique based on keys between a 
specific range. It works by counting the number of objects 
having distinct key values (kind of hashing). 
Then modify the count array such that each element at each index 
stores the sum of previous counts. 
Calculate the position of each object in the output sequence.

Linear time. Counting sort runs in O(n)O(n) time, making it 
asymptotically faster than comparison-based sorting algorithms.

Space cost. If the range of potential values is big, then 
counting sort requires a lot of space (perhaps more than 
O(n)).
